# Hive-Case-Study

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
In this modern era, Tech companies are exploring ways to improve their sales by analyzing customer behaviour and gaining insights about product trends. In order to make better business decisions, E- commerce websites are finding their way by tracking the number of clicks made by customers and their spending time on websites in searching for patterns within them. This kind of collected data is called a click stream data. Furthermore, the websites make it easier for customers to find the products they require without much scavenging. In this case study, we are working with click stream data by getting insights and making decisions upon how the E-commerce websites can improve their sales.

# OBJECTIVE:
